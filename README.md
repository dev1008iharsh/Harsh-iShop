### Note - I intentionally remove some parts of the project from every file and main storyboard so that no one can misuse my project. If you want to watch my full project code, you can contact me using any social media platform. If you are a developer, you can understand what I removed. On top of that, this is not my latest project; it was created in the initial years, so the code will look like that. This is a 100% working project, and I can run it on my Xcode.

Application summary - Over the years, I've worked on many E-Commerce projects, one of which was my own project called Harsh iShop, which I fully developed from design to deploy, from design of graphical user interfaces to the IPA (iOS App Store Package), to sending applications to clients for testing. I was doing everything, right down to the coding.Product and order are managing from backend side which I managed to fit into my project. It supports displaying, searching, adding products to the cart, selecting a date and time for delivery of the products, applying coupon codes, updating addresses with a Google map, latitude-longitude, and the Google address autocomplete API, placing orders, viewing orders, and canceling orders.Support for customer support, Fresh chat SDK API, payment gateway implementation, multiple languages (English and Arabic), JSON Rest API, and swift model class implementation with suitable MVC architecture.
