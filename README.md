Application summary - Over the years, I've worked on many E-Commerce projects, one of which was my own project called Harsh iShop, which I fully developed from design to deploy, from design of graphical user interfaces to the IPA (iOS App Store Package), to sending applications to clients for testing. I was doing everything, right down to the coding.Product and order are managing from backend side which I managed to fit into my project. It supports displaying, searching, adding products to the cart, selecting a date and time for delivery of the products, applying coupon codes, updating addresses with a Google map, latitude-longitude, and the Google address autocomplete API, placing orders, viewing orders, and canceling orders.Support for customer support, Fresh chat SDK API, payment gateway implementation, multiple languages (English and Arabic), JSON Rest API, and swift model class implementation with suitable MVC architecture.
