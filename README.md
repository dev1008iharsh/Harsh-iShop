## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This project was created in **2020 during the early stage of my iOS development journey**.  
Some parts of the source code and storyboard have been intentionally removed to prevent misuse.

- The application is fully functional  
- The project can still be built and run locally in Xcode  
- Full source is available upon request for legitimate purposes  

Most modern best practices were adopted in my later projects.
